The trajectory chronicles the previous AI engineer's work on the Acode Lab application. Initially, the engineer established an MVP, implementing core Q&A, gamification, and B2B features, alongside fixing React 19 compatibility and navigation issues. A significant turning point occurred after multiple bug reports, culminating in a user's critical diagnosis in Chat 210 that most previous implementations were non-functional or placeholders. This led to a complete, user-instructed rebuild of both the backend () and frontend (), aiming for a truly functional core Q&A, admin, and profile system. The engineer demonstrated iterative bug fixing, including JWT compatibility and frontend rendering issues, finally delivering a foundational application with a robust backend and key frontend functionalities as per the detailed rebuild instructions.

The Acode Lab aims to be a global platform for tech professionals, divided into Acode Lab: Q&A (knowledge hub with code editor, tags, voting, gamification via PC for reputation and PCon for virtual currency) and Acode Lab: Connect (professional networking with profiles, news feed). Strategic pillars include user engagement, content, monetization (B2B Recruitment Panel, sponsored challenges, creator economy), and advanced technology (search engine, security).

The MVP prioritized a basic Q&A system with voting and gamification (PC/PCon), initially without AI, and in Brazilian Portuguese, adhering to a black, copper, and white design. Subsequent user demands refined the scope, particularly for the Admin Panel (bot creation, user/company management, full PC/PCon control, moderation like ban/mute), full profile customization, and a Featured Portfolios of the Week section in Connect. The application now features a rebuilt backend and functional frontend for core Q&A, admin management, and user profiles.

<code_architecture>
**High-Level Architecture:**
The application adheres to a full-stack architecture, utilizing a React.js frontend, a FastAPI backend, and a MongoDB database. RESTful APIs facilitate communication between the frontend and backend, with Kubernetes Ingress enforcing specific routing rules (e.g.,  prefix for backend).

**Directory Structure:**



**Detailed Structure & File Summaries:**

-   ****
    -   : Manages Python dependencies. **Changes:** Updated multiple times to include , , , , , reflecting the complete FastAPI setup.
    -   : The central FastAPI application.
        -   **Summary:** This file was completely rebuilt. It now includes:
            -   **Initial Configuration:**  app setup,  for password hashing,  for JWT.
            -   **MongoDB Configuration:** Connection using  and .
            -   **CORS Middleware:** Configured for cross-origin requests.
            -   **Pydantic Models:** Comprehensive models for , , , , , , , , , including detailed fields for gamification and user status.
            -   **Extensive Endpoints (45+):** Covers Auth (register, login, me), Questions (create, get, get by ID, vote, view, answers, create answers), Users (profile update, get profile, follow), Admin (stats, pending answers, validate/reject answers, create bot questions/answers, user/company management, moderation, point control), Voting (for answers), Portfolios (weekly submission/retrieval, voting).
            -   **Gamification Logic:** Integrated PC/PCon point calculation and rank determination based on user actions and admin validation.
        -   **Changes:** Underwent a complete reconstruction and multiple subsequent fixes (e.g.,  to ), resulting in a robust, feature-rich backend as per the detailed user specifications.
    -   : Contains  and .

    -   : The main React component.
        -   **Summary:** This file was also completely rebuilt and restructured several times. It now centrally manages:
            -   **Routing:** Defines routes for Homepage, Login, Register, Questions (list and individual), Dashboard, Profile, Admin, Connect, Articles, Store, Jobs.
            -   **Authentication Context:** Integrated directly into  to avoid module import issues, managing global user state and authentication.
            -   **User Interface:** Renders main layout, navigation, and dynamically displays pages using Shadcn/UI components.
            -   **Functionality Integration:** Includes logic and UI for:
                -   Questions (listing, search, creation modal with code editor, individual question page with replies and voting).
                -   User Authentication (login, registration forms).
                -   Admin Panel (dashboard, pending answer validation, bot content publishing).
                -   Profile customization (theme, banner, social links).
                -   Basic navigation and placeholders for other sections.
        -   **Changes:** Heavily modified, initially to replace placeholders with functional components for Q&A, Admin, Connect, Store (Chat 76), then further for Admin enhancements (Chat 97-118), and then a *complete rebuild* after Chat 210, consolidating many components/contexts directly into  to resolve persistent import and rendering issues (e.g., ,  definition). It also had a missing  fix.

<pending_tasks>
The AI engineer has completed all requested tasks up to the comprehensive rebuild of the core Q&A, Admin Panel, and Profile features. The remaining systems to be implemented, as outlined in the last summary (Chat 217), are:
-   Connect (feed social)
-   Loja PCon (PCon Store)
-   Portal de vagas B2B (B2B Job Portal)
-   Sistema de artigos (Articles system)
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The Acode Lab application has recently undergone a significant, user-mandated rebuild of its core components, driven by a critical assessment that previous implementations were largely non-functional.

Currently, the **backend () is declared 100% functional**, having been reconstructed from scratch. It includes:
-   A full FastAPI application structure.
-   Robust MongoDB integration with asynchronous drivers.
-   Complete JWT-based authentication and authorization.
-   Comprehensive Pydantic models for all entities (Users, Questions, Answers, Companies, etc.).
-   Over 45 endpoints supporting Auth, Questions (creation, retrieval, voting, views, answers), User profiles (customization, following), and an extensive Admin panel (stats, answer validation, bot content publishing, user/company management, moderation, point control).
-   Integrated gamification logic for PC and PCon points, and rank calculation.

The **frontend () has also been completely rebuilt and is currently functional** for the core user journeys:
-   **Q&A System:** Users can view a list of questions, search them, create new questions (with a code editor and tags), and access individual question pages to post replies and cast votes. View counters are also active.
-   **Admin Panel:** Accessible to administrators, it provides a dashboard with statistics and crucial functionality to review, validate, and reject pending answers. Admin can also publish content on behalf of bots.
-   **User Authentication & Profiles:** Secure registration and login are operational. Users can access their profile page to fully customize details like theme color, banner image, custom title, social links, bio, location, and skills.
-   **Navigation:** The primary navigation system is functional, allowing users to move between key sections like Homepage, Login, Register, Questions, Dashboard, Admin Panel, and Profile.

While the core Q&A, Admin, and Profile functionalities are now operational after multiple rounds of bug fixing (including JWT compatibility, missing component imports, and React rendering issues), other major sections like the Connect social feed, PCon Store, B2B Job Portal, and Articles system are explicitly listed as the next areas for development, currently existing as placeholders or incomplete features within the application.
